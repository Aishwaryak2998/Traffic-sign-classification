# Traffic-sign-classification
I used the German-traffic-sign dataset in my project (downloaded it from Kaggle). 
The images in the datset were not in the optimal condition and therefore I altered and resized them to fit my needs. 

Platform : VSCode
Language: Python

You will need to "pip install" the following:
1) NumPy
2) Pandas
3) Keras
4) Matplotlib 
5) OpenCV

The german-traffic-sign dataset has the following files in it:
1) signnames.cvs
2) train.p
3) test.p
4) valid.p
